## Building, Testing, and Installation

Run `flatpak-builder` to configure the build environment, download dependencies, build, and install

    flatpak-builder build io.github.leolost2605.detective.yml --user --install --force-clean --install-deps-from=appcenter

execute with `io.github.leolost2605.detective`

    flatpak run io.github.leolost2605.detective

## What to expect

Nothing fancy.
This is more of a sideproject for me where I want to try the power of GTK's ListModels, Expressions, Sorters and Filters.
If something useful comes from it, great, if not experience was gained :)

## Credits

Many things here (especially the plugins like Calculations) were inspired and taken from synapse and the elementary applications menu. Huge credit to them <3
