    <p>Features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Search for and open applications</li>
      <li>Search for files and open them in the right apps</li>
      <li>Do quick maths just by typing an expression</li>

      Detective requires advanced permissions to properly find and launch applications on the host system. For this reason and for your information warnings might be shown on the app page in your app store.
